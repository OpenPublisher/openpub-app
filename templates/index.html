        Open Publisher is a permissionless Ethereum protocol which enables instant censorship-resistant publishing.
        When a user submits data to be published, the data is cryptographically hashed and written to an ERC-721 PUB token
        which is distributed to the submitter. Posession of PUB tokens allows the user to participate in governance of the protocol.

        Open Publisher is a new system for publishing in which researchers instantly recieve a
        permanent digital reciept upon submission of their data. This receipt stores a unique fingerprint of
        their data so they can prove ownership of it even after it's released to the public. Users can then use this receipt
        to propose changes to the network and vote on proposals from other users.
